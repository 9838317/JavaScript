	//This is about block scope.
	/*
	1. 	Some of the programming language, like C and Java, have a feature called "block scope".
		In programming, when some codes are embranced by curly braces, they are called a block. 
		block scope means that, when you declared some variable in the block, then it is generally impossible to use the variable outside the block, like:

		{
			int blockVariable = 10;
		}

		print blockVariable;		//this is wrong because the variable hasn't been initialized.
	
	2.  however, in javascript, there is no such "block" thing. It means that, if you declare a variable in the block, then it could as well be referred in outer scope. see following:

	{
		var a = 1020;
	}

	//a will be alerted.
	alert(a);
