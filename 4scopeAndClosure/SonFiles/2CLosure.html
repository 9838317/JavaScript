	//This is about closure.
	/*

		closure wiki:

		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29

		"A closure is a record storing a function together with an environment". 
				in a deeper sense, when a variable is used in a function but without declaring, it's the simplese case of a closure. 
		
		a. environment/scope: each function has its own scope. Here we define 2 functions and 3 scopes:	
			function parent() and function son()

			1.	the scope that creates parent()    is called  scopeGlobal. 
			2.	the scope that creates son()       is actually the scope that function parent() is in charge of. we call it scopeParent. 
			3.  the scope that son()               is in charge of, we call it scopeSon.

			 See following:	

				***************
					//here is scopeGlobal, in this env we create parent().
					function parent()
					{
						//here is scopeParent, in this env we create son().
						function son()
						{
							//Here is scopeSon
						}
					}
				****************
			With the function definitions above, we can do some manipulation. 

		b.  If we take son() as a return function of parent(), then something useful and funny will happen.
	*/	
	
	//Following is the example, 
	function parent(paraA, paraB)
	{

		function son(closurePara)
		{
			return paraA + paraB + closurePara;
			//Here is scopeSon
		}
		return son
	}

	var a = parent(4, 5);
	console.log(a(10));	

	/*
	In conclusion, closure is the usage of a variable inside a function without first declaring it.

	Practically, we can use a 2 degree function(function inside another function) to keep the scope of the parent function forever available. This is the most frequent usage of closure.
